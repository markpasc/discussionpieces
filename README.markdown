This was a hack day experiment and possibly my first App Engine app. You can [see it in action at discussionpieces.appspot.com](http://discussionpieces.appspot.com/).

The icons on the site were provided by [Firewheel Design's Iconbuffet](http://s17.zastica.com/entries/iconbuffet-is-dead/) (and as such I cannot redistribute them here).
